The Lebanese Red Cross provides First Aid trainings, Basic Life Support (BLS) and Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support (ACLS), to medical professionals and the public. In addition to the Lebanese Red Cross, other organizations such as UNICEF, Medair, and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) provide similar support and intervention.
The heatmap is developed in a multilayered way to showcase the distribution of first aid centers across Lebanon.  It features multiple interactive tools such as the slider which can be used to manipulate the areas contains a certain number of first aid care centers. The red gradient used reflects the red cross color, and in addition to the box size, it shows which areas contain the highest to least presence. The color palette and font size can also be manipulated based on preference.
